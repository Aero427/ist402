<h3 id="header-f3f425c3-7a0b-d2d3-8ca6-9de697032249">Written response</h3>
<p>To each technology, I'd like you to write a short blog post that reads like a one-page white paper about the technology at hand. Try to keep it to around 500 words but thoroughness is more important then "did I make the paper long enough".</p>
<p>As long as it answers questions like the following:</p>
<ul><li>What is it and why does it exist</li>
<li>What industries use it / who are players that popularize it?</li>
<li>What alternatives exist to it?</li>
<li>Links / Resources for people who want to learn more about it</li>
<li>What you struggled with in using it?</li>
<li>What you liked most about using it?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-03b736c0-01b0-495d-771d-2aa14a2357fb"><span>Video response</span></h3>
<p><span>Explainer videos are great, especially for people on the go via podcasts or who are looking to get a refresher on a topic before a meeting. Make a 3-5 minute screencast that sets up what the topic is, and runs through some brief examples of it. This is open to interpretation but you are trying to explain to others why this topic is valuable and when they'd use it.</span></p>
<ul><li><span>Say quickly who you are (branding is important!)</span></li>
<li><span>Explain in ~20 seconds what the topic is and maybe extend this with who's using it or why it matters</span></li>
<li><span>Talk about the topic while showing a demo of it or place you found most useful to learn (walking while chewing gum)</span></li>
<li><span>Show links to resources where you can learn more about it</span></li>
<li><span>Awesome sign off phrase to remember you by</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Here are a few examples of the kind of formality that is expected (flip on screencast software, record screen, talk). Part of the video reflection is to get more comfortable with speaking about technical concepts and to improve your ability to rationalize what your doing. I don't use a script (ever) for my videos but that's up to you.</span></p>
