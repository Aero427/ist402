<p>For this lab we're going to look at a few different services that are like codepen but allow for more advanced use-cases and development to support web components (and other front end languages).</p>
<h3 id="header-ddd94925-081e-fca1-5083-eb8bfe7d1247">Exercises</h3>
<p>We're going to look at some different examples in different platforms that are similar to codepen but I also wanted to point out this really slick, business use-case demo from a popular web components company named Vaadin: <a href="https://demo.vaadin.com/customer-crud-app/">https://demo.vaadin.com/customer-crud-app/</a>
</p>
<p><b>Glitch.com</b>
 - A basic example of referencing and leveraging existing web components to do small things and insane things. Buttons, calendars, or... 3d model viewing???</p>

<p><b>Stackblitz.com</b>
 - An example of three different web component libraries achieving the same result through similar syntax:

<p>For practice as this is a code concept we are going to be taking a small coding exercise. Don't worry though, Google's developers have you covered with a great, easy to understand 5 page tutorial built into their documentation. <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/try">Try LitElement</a>
. We're going to fork and modify something but then we have a specific type of topic prompt for the response:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Complete the <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/try">Try LitElement</a>
 practice exercise.</li>
<li>Pick <b>one of these </b>
to frame your writing and video response:	
    <ul>
    	<li>Make the <i>business</i>
, <i>security</i>
, <i>accessibility </i>
or <i>design consistency </i>
<b>case for using web components</b>
. Why is this a technology your next employer should consider adopting? Who else is doing it and what does it mean for development? Inspect source on websites such as <a href="https://haxtheweb.org">HAXTheWeb</a>
, <a href="https://youtube.com/">YouTube</a>
, <a href="https://my.xfinity.com/">Comcast</a>
, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield">EA Games</a>
 or others in order to make the case real.</li>
<li><i>Package manager / tooling pro</i>
: Setup yarn / npm and create an element using Open-WC, the tooling the pros use <a href="https://open-wc.org/guide/">https://open-wc.org/guide/</a>
 and do a video on that process, making a simple hero-card with properties like name (<b>String</b>
), cape (<b>Boolean</b>
), super powers (<b>Array</b>
) and demonstrating usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Record your video and link to it from a new page in your previous HAXcms site OR <a href="https://dev.to/">do a post on Dev.to</a>
, a popular medium clone that's growing in popularity with developer audience.</li>
<li>Post a link to whereever you have the link / videos post to the <b>#lab-10-webcomponents</b>
 in slack</li>
</ol>
