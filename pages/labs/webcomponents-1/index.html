<p>This week we're going to write some basic code to make a web component with an optional tooling based approach to web development for those that have written HTML, CSS and JavaScript before. Let's take a look at some cool web services too!</p>
<p>Another take</p>
<p>Did this topic not make sense to you? Do you think maybe I missed some things and want another primer? <a href="https://oer.hax.psu.edu/rrw5156/sites/final-project/web-components">Here's a past student's project site</a>
 where they break down and explain addition important aspects of Web components and different libraries / resources you can use to learn more.</p>

<p>We're going to look at some different examples in different platforms that are similar to codepen but I also wanted to point out this really slick, business use-case demo from a popular web components company named <b>Vaadin</b>
 <a href="https://demo.vaadin.com/customer-crud-app/">https://demo.vaadin.com/customer-crud-app/</a>

<p><b>Glitch.com</b>
 - A basic example of referencing and leveraging existing web components to do small things and insane things. Buttons, calendars, or... 3d model viewing???</p>

<p>For practice as this is a code concept we are going to be taking a small coding exercise. Don't worry though, Google's developers have you covered with a great, easy to understand 5 page tutorial built into their documentation.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Complete the <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/try">Try LitElement</a>
 practice exercise.</li>
<li>Pick <b>one of these </b>
to frame your writing and video response:	
    <ul>
    	<li><b>Noncoders: </b>
Make the <i>business</i>
, <i>security</i>
, <i>accessibility </i>
or <i>design consistency </i>
<b>case for using web components</b>
. Why is this a technology your next employer should consider adopting? Who else is doing it and what does it mean for development? Inspect source on websites such as <a href="https://haxtheweb.org">HAXTheWeb</a>
, <a href="https://youtube.com/">YouTube</a>
, <a href="https://my.xfinity.com/">Comcast</a>
, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield">EA Games</a>
 or others in order to make the case real.</li>
<li><i><b>Coders: </b>
Package manager / tooling pro</i>
: Setup yarn / npm and create an element using Open-WC, the tooling the pros use <a href="https://open-wc.org/guide/">https://open-wc.org/guide/</a>
 and do a video on that process, making a simple hero-card with properties like name (<b>String</b>
), cape (<b>Boolean</b>
), super powers (<b>Array</b>
), things like that or make up your own element that makes sense to you like <b>portfolio-card</b>
 and demonstrate usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Write up 250 words making the case for web components or explaining what you did in the video and how someone else can (in the case of doing the making a web component case).</li>
<li>Add your write up and video to <a href="https://dev.to/">a post on Dev.to</a>
. Dev.to is a popular medium clone that's growing in popularity with developer audiences and there's a good chance others will read your article given that there's growing interest in web components! (you can post on a hax.psu.edu site if you don't feel comfortable doing this write up publicly).</li>
<li>Post a link to your dev.to article and <b>#lab-10-webcomponents</b>
 in slack</li>
</ol>
