<img src="files/Drupal2020.jpg" alt="Data model we built in class, Spring 2020." style="width: 85%;"/><p>This is to be done in class with image posted here for reference but in case you miss the activity that generates it. <span>Take 10 minutes and figure out the fields and relationships of this data:</span></p>
<ul><li><b>Courses</b>
</li>
<ul><li>{come up with the relationships}</li>
<li><span>{come up with the fields}</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span><b>Faculty</b>
</span></li>
<ul><li><span>{come up with the relationships}</span></li>
<li><span>{come up with the fields}</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span><b>Rooms</b>

<h2 id="header-387e7d28-b160-8616-d9aa-2cdb3c44fd52">Lab Context</h2>
<ul><li><span>You are the site builder that works in the organization who has been doing Grav / WP</span></li>
<li><span>You’ve starting to do websites that require a lot of data and users and you don’t think that WordPress is the right fit anymore</span></li>
<li><span>Your Project Manager (with<b><i> the same name as you, weird huh?</i>
</b>
) agrees but has never used Drupal and is concerned about you being able to handle it</span></li>
<li><span>They give you a map of the data model and ask you to model the information in Drupal and create a displays that pull data together</span></li>
<li><span>"NO problem boss with my same name!" - You say out-loud, bizarre way to address a boss but hey...</span><br/></li>
<li>"I can figure Drupal out and win the lottery when it comes to Site Building. Sucker! This is my meal ticket outta this joint!" (hopefully you say this in your head)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-b960feb4-8320-9182-4e9c-32ba5ea2b52e">Lab Deliverable</h2>
<ul><li>Create a Drupal site that accurately represents the data model that we’ve   agreed on in class (on website / slack)</li>
<li>Model these entities:</li>
<ul><li>Course</li>
<li>Instructor</li>
<li>Room</li>
</ul>
<li><span>Create 5 courses on the site</span></li>
<ul><li><span>either your own or make them up whatever</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>Create rooms and faculty and associate them with these courses so all courses have faculty and a room</span><br/></li>
<li>Create a <b>View</b>
 that shows the list of courses</li>
<ul><li>Title this schedule</li>
<li>Make sure it shows up in the menu bar</li>
<li>Make it display as a table</li>
<li>Add fields that are relevant for people viewing the site</li>
</ul>
<li><span><b>BONUS 2PTS: Create a View showing a list of the faculty</b>
</span></li>
<ul><li><span>Title this Our Faculty</span></li>
<li><span>Make sure it shows up in the menu bar</span></li>
<li><span>Make it display as a grid / list</span></li>
<li><span>Add a field for photo to the instructor type</span></li>
<li><span>Use a “Relationship” in the view in order to show the courses faculty members are teaching as well as their name and photo</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-bdf83f14-e317-db5e-245f-1b01d61cab97">Submitting the Lab</h2>
<ul><li>Create your Drupal site building out the view and content types that we chose to model our data off of this week</li>
<li>Create a Home page in the menu that includes:</li>
<ul><li>500 words on why Drupal is the choice for big organizations</li>
<li>Links to 3 resources backing this claim</li>
<li>A link to your YouTube video</li>
</ul>
<li><span>Record the video demonstrating the following techniques (or both if you like)</span><br/></li>
<ul><li> How to create a <b>Content Type</b>
 and <b>Add Fields</b>
 then <b>Create Content</b>
 of that type and connect the concepts for viewers of your video<br/><br/><b>OR</b>
</li>
<li>How to create views, adding filters and sorting to the view then showing the view in use with data present in the site and explain what the <b>View</b>
 is doing that makes it so impressive</li>
</ul>
<li><span>Post your link to your site in: <b>#lab7-drupal</b>
</span></li>
</ul>
