<p>This week we're going to improve upon our brand through critique and self reflection. We want to get our brands in as good a shape as possible prior to all the hands on labs and topics we'll be engaging in this semester.</p>
<h2 id="header-269a6260-4d70-a51e-cc8a-d6dffd873f11">Critique</h2>
<p>Look to the people around you in class (say hi, scary, I know). Ask what their brand is (ask three people), find it on the <b>#lab-1-brand </b>
Slack<b> </b>
channel to find them on YouTube. Watch their video for the git submission last week. Take note of the following and offer them suggestions on where they can improve:</p>
<ul><li>Brand name / recognition</li>
<li>Style in video / audio quality / space used to record</li>
<li>Usage of social media (if any)</li>
<li>Images in headers and icon form on YouTube/Github/Social Media</li>
<li>Video descriptions, links in the description area</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-be5954b0-84ee-1912-656f-567e8eb0c229">Writing</h2>
<p>I want you to produce <b>recommendations for each of the three brands</b>
 you selected on how they can improve their brand (these can be bullet points / short sentences on each of the points above).<b> Take the feedback for each brand and use the "Thread" feature of slack to post the suggestions to them in the #lab-1-brand channel (since everyone posted there already)</b>
</p>

<p>For your video reflection I want you to produce a video explaining one of the topics related to our guest speaker as well as reflecting on the feedback you got from classmates. Start your video by discussing ways you could improve your brand's SEO via these changes as SEO is related to how well google and others can index your content so others can find it.</p>
<p>After you reflect on the feedback and how you plan to implement it, talk about one of these topics below. I've included a list of potential questions to answer throughout your explainer video to help you find things to google / form discussion points..</p>
<ul><li><b>SEO</b>
 - Search engine optimization. How SEO influences you showing up in search engine results? What can you do to improve your SEO? What are some things you can do this semester to ensure you have high SEO when we're done? Finding links that explain the subject either from technical (HTML structure / metadata) or from a marketer perspective.</li>
<li><a href="https://oerschema.org">OERSchema</a>
 - What a schema is, what OER Schema is trying to achieve, and showing an example from the documentation and explaining it. This can be anything related to micro-data, how it interplay with SEO and search indexing, or even privacy concerns associated with being able to associate public data a bit too accurately.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-2e9caccb-cc0e-c954-3176-61f57c6455ea">Rubric</h2>
<ul><li>Did you review three other brands and provide feedback on each? (3 pts)</li>
<li>Did you reflect on your own brand and how to improve it's SEO? (3pts)</li>
<li>Did you communicate effectively about the importance of SEO / OERSchema? (4 pts)</li>
</ul>
<p>When complete, submit a word doc to the <b>#lab-3-brand-review</b>
 channel on slack by Sunday which includes your review of your classmates brands as well as link to your video submission.</p>
