<li>I'll turn it over to you all and you'll have any time remaining to ask questions, start setting up accounts, etc. The lab below is due by <b>Sunday at 11pm</b>
.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="header-5032f248-40c9-aa1c-02f5-79d24e364750">Now it's your turn</h2>
<ol><li>Create a Slack account and join two slack channels</li>
<ul><li><b>IST 402</b>
<span> - <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/ist402-sp20/shared_invite/enQtODk0ODQ2OTIzNjY0LWZmYTJhMWQ4ZDQzYmRhMTU5NjA3YTBjNDc5ZGJhNmE0MGMxMjA5NjFhODJiNzA2ZTljZGIzYjM5NjA5ZTMzMDQ">Slack Invite</a>
</span></li>
<ul><li>We'll use this as the primary working space / link sharing / communication space for the course</li>
</ul>
<li><b>ELMS: Learning Network - </b>
<span><a href="https://join.slack.com/t/elmsln/shared_invite/enQtMjg2MzUxMTYyNjcyLWNhYzU1ODk0MjQ5MWZlNjVjNWJkMmZlODJiMGNmNDBjODk2NDc2MDUzNTZkODE4NTRiMjUzYzkzOTBkNjI4NGE">Slack Invite</a>
 (optional)</span></li>
<ul><li>Me and my band of change agents are available to you. If you want to get more involved in this space beyond what we'll experience in class or have questions about the education or web industry, the door is always open</li>
<li>There's developers and educational professionals from multiple universities there, IST and otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Think up a brand / identity / persona for your online identity as an IT professional</li>
<ul><li>What does your brand feel like?</li>
<ul><li>Great Explainer? Hero's Journey? Future CIO? Coding beginner? Business and Tech fusing?</li>
</ul>
<li>Pick a name that you can attempt to use across "all platforms"</li>
<ul><li>Domain name, Github, YouTube, etc</li>
</ul>
<li>Note: You MAY want to divorce this from your real persona / personal accounts. Everyone does it differently in industry; many merge, there are risks associated with that. I fragment on YouTube  but generally keep all mine unified.<br/></li>
<li>Because we haven't started a blog yet (but let's get in the swing of doing a write up and a video), write up a paragraph describing your brand in Word/Docs</li>
</ul>
<li>Register this account on <b>Github</b>
 and <b>YouTube</b>
</li>
<ul><li><span>Be sure to set the username to be the same across them</span></li>
<li><span>You aren't required to register other socials but if your trying to increase the reach of your brand and SEO, register this account on OTHER spaces as well.</span></li>
</ul>
<li>Create a Playlist on YouTube called "Clarissa explains it all", replacing <span><i>Clarissa</i>
</span> with your persona (or whatever brand name YOU want, we'll view several in class)</li>
<li>Create a screencast that's ~5 minutes long that includes the following:</li>
<ul><li><span>Pick a screen-casting solution <a href="resources/screencasting">from the Screen-casting resources area</a>
</span></li>
<li><span>introducing your channel <i><b>from a technology professional context</b>
</i>
</span></li>
<li><span>Showing your favorite tech blog / anything you've read and enjoy learning from online currently. Talk about an article on the blog while it's being shown in order to practice the explainer concept.</span></li>
<li><span>End with what piece of technology you'd like to learn more about how it works this semester</span></li>
</ul>
<li>Post a link to this video on your social accounts (Twitter / LinkedIn) <i>if you care to do so.</i>
</li>
<li><span>Use the </span><b>IST402 Slack directly</b>
<span>and upload your Word/Doc file to the channel named </span><b>#lab-1-brand</b>
<i>. </i>
<span>Make sure to include a link to your YouTube Channel and Video post in the bottom of your "blog" post</span><br/></li>
<li><span><b>Extra if you'd like</b>
</span></li>
<ol><li>If you <a href="https://twitter.com/btopro">@btopro</a>
 on twitter I'll RT to increase reach</li>
