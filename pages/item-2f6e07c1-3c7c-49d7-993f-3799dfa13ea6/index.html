<h3 id="header-bc5b3d65-6131-6cb8-274a-7291fefee156">Scenario</h3>
<ul><li>There are websites on the internet that are not made up to snuff for accessibility and that makes people without screens mad</li>
<li>Beyond mad, it makes them unable to actually use your product / website</li>
<li>This is both bad to do to a human being and stupid; you want their cash regardless of how they use your website!</li>
<li>But if only there were ways of learning how to improve the accessibility and SEO of a website at the same time...</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-7ba5b74c-b1ff-d6de-18bc-79dcc0f4d062">Deliverable</h3>
<ul><li>Perform a web.dev / lighthouse and WAVE audit on a website</li>
<li>Review the feedback it gives and identify three areas for improvement from the audit that were things you didn’t know about before</li>
<li>Research (Google) how to solve these things and propose potential solutions to the problems</li>
<li>These problems can be SEO / A11y / Performance related; anything that’s given by the reports that you can interpret, research and then write / do a video about how to resolve</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-6869354b-dd1c-46fe-7670-a1e78b49cf4c">Option 1</h3>
<ul><li>Audit a website for a club, small business or other website affiliated with you or important to you in some way</li>
<li>This could also be something you don’t care about, just has to be something that generates meaningful data to analyze</li>
<li>Write on dev.to or hax.psu.edu for this option</li>
<li>If you own the site and can fix it this would make for an even more powerful / actionable way to solve this</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-de46fb17-799f-7128-ace9-6626fd21eb30">Option 2</h3>
<ul><li>Audit a specific page in the course website or using hax.psu.edu to make a basic hello-world page</li>
<li>Do your write up in our team’s issue queue <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues">https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues</a>
</li>
<li>By doing this you’ll help our projects (which are big while team is small) and improve your own SEO footprint via github posting / cross posting</li>
<ul><li>next week we’ll get into github so this is a look ahead</li>
</ul>
</ul>
