<p>We're going to strive for this general flow to each week of the semester. A few specific topics will deviate and we may have some guest speakers, but generally this is what class will look like together</p>
<ul><li>Capability / skill / technology of the day with quick discussion of what people think that's for, or places they've heard of it previously</li>
<li>A lecture (~45 min) about the skill or industry, who uses it, and how it's put into practice. This is taking the concept into the theory realm.</li>
<li>Screw theory, we're only going to learn by getting our hands dirty! Everything from here is practice and digging into the lab to experience it for ourselves.</li>
<li>Next we'll all follow along doing a very basic example of the skill / a warm up activity. This might be running commands in a terminal, editing things on Github to see how change records flow, or exploring the GravCMS user interface. Something that's all of us following along and doing it together, stopping to answer any questions along the way and ensuring there is a baseline understanding.</li>
<li>The rest of the time is open lab. We'll have a lab each week with a few options for experiencing and implementing the skill in practice.</li>
<li>What ever you don't get done in class is to be completed after class but we'll always start on the work together in case there are issues. The majority of the labs are structured to be able to be finished within the class time allotted so that you can focus on your reflection writing / video after class.</li>
</ul>
