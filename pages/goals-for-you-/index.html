<h2 id="header-9a212dc7-d188-b692-3d98-04b337ef0be9">My hope for you</h2>
<p>That you'll use this experience as a vehicle to free your mind and enact your own change on the world. Whether it's the lectures and concepts of this course, a great blog, a TED talk, or even watching a movie like The Matrix or Fight Club, whatever it takes to free your mind from the factory model of education and being a well rounded, independent minded person. That's what I hope anyone reading this.</p>
<p>I was not a happy or free thinking person when I was in college, or when I took this course. But through experiences, meeting people of different perspectives, graduate school, and some well placed lectures and speakers, I was given a more open minded, holistic, and stress free perspective on reality.</p>
<p>I hope this for you all as well and may this play a small part in your journey toward the person you are to be in this world. You are important, needed, and welcome. And I hope you build the best you in this time here in order to build the best world for all of us.</p>

<h3 id="header-6cd226ad-f404-1bed-4a2c-e7ab129f9b73">Instructional Goals for you</h3>
<p>My primary goal for you is to learn new things about modern web technologies while getting hands on with them. More specifically..</p>
<ul><li>Learning not just what a technology is but...</li>
<ul><li>Who's using it, what industries, what web services</li>
<li>Getting hands on and implementing it small scale</li>
<li>Being able to better communicate purpose and ideas around it</li>
</ul>
<li>Building a digital footprint of YOU, the IT worker / manager / developer / whatever your path, just that it's out there!</li>
<ul><li>Creating a YouTube channel of explainer videos about the topics discussed in class</li>
<li>Creating a Blog about these same topics</li>
<li>Creating social coder accounts and connecting them all together (like Github, TravisCI, Stackblitz, CodePen, Glitch, etc)</li>
</ul>
<li>Learn about all levels of "the stack" in order to better empathize with those working in different levels of the stack from you (or people you'll one day manage)</li>
<li>Have a website on the internet that you control and have a window into how all aspects of it function.</li>
<li><i>Take hand written tests</i>
 and <i>use platforms and technologies that no employer on earth will care about</i>
 once you graduate</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Ok.. maybe not that last one but the rest are legit.</span></p>
