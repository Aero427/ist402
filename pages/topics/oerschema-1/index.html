<p>Michael is the creator of a standard called <a href="https://oerschema.org/">OERSchema</a>
 which extends <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org ontologies</a>
 in order to inform our machine overlords about educational concepts. OERSchema is an ontology that we leverage behind the scenes in many projects our group works on and the HAX editor (which we'll cover later in the semester) is able to write content that has OERSchema baked into it automatically.</p>
<p>I'll be presenting at two conferences this week so I will be traveling during class. Our TAs are available for answering questions about how to complete this lab assignment and please ask questions of Michael about OERSchema.</p>
<p>Next unit we'll start diving into some HTML/CSS/Javascript fundamentals mostly through a platform called codepen.</p>
