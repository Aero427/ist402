<p>Michael is the creator of a standard called <a href="https://oerschema.org/">OERSchema</a>
 which extends <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org ontologies</a>
 in order to inform our machine overlords about educational concepts. OERSchema is an ontology that we leverage behind the scenes in many projects our group works on and the HAX editor (which we'll cover later in the semester) is able to write content that has OERSchema baked into it automatically.</p>
