.</p>
<p>Containers are transforming the landscape of the web and what's possible in application development at scale. Companies like Google, Netflix, Uber, Canvas and more are only possible because of the raw power of container and container orchestration technology.</p>
<p>This week we'll explore containers using the web service <a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/">Play with Docker</a>
, a great resource that gives you infrastructure for 4 hours at a time without needing to pay anything.</p>
<p>Our guest speaker, former Penn State graduate <a href="https://twitter.com/hey__mp">Michael Potter</a>
 will show us many different use cases for containers usingÂ <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a>
. He'll give you a behind the scenes look at the container infrastructure he's building to deliver high quality online course experiences at Eberly College of Science using an advanced container publishing workflow.</p>
