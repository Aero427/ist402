<p>Git provides a command line interface or CLI that allows developers to track changes in the code they are writing. Some basic commands in git are as follows</p>
<code-sample copy-clipboard-button type="html">  <template preserve-content="preserve-content"># create a new repo
git init
# create a file
touch Readme.md
# add file to git
git add -A
# "commit" the change
git commit -m "Initial readme created"
# "push" the change to a repository
git push origin master</template>
</code-sample>
<p>All git is doing, is keeping track of a simple record that indicates what a line number WAS and what it should be now. Here's an example from the HAXcms Readme file</p>
<img src="files/2019-08-24_15-21-52.png" alt="Looking at a git commit diff to see what something became" style="width: 100%;"/><p>In this example, we can see that lines 18 and 19 in the file called README.md were changed. The left in red is what it was. The right in green is what it became. This visualization is provided by Github, where I manage the vast majority of my projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>
 is a popular space for developers in and out of open source software communities to collaborate. Microsoft recently purchased Github but the platform has been popular with developers of open source projects for over a decade prior.</p>
<p>Github has gained popularity in part because</p>
<ul><li>Git as a version control system has largely won the popularity contest</li>
<li>They allow you to use the platform for free so long as what you do is open source</li>
<li>Private repos then allow companies to align their open contribution strategy with their internal development workflows</li>
<li>Github's social networking aspects around issue queues, following, forking and staring repos have all helped improve the social aspect of software development online</li>
<li><i>Github is adding capabilities to make code contributions without needing to understand everything that goes into making the contribution. </i>
Capabilities like clicking edit on the website, making a change in the browser and typing the commit name, then it automatically saving the change or creating a "Pull Request" for whoever owns the file</li>
<li>All of these reasons are why developers <b>and non-developers</b>
Â are joining Github to do a lot of open source contribution.</li>
<li>Lots of other services and "apps" are starting to integrate with Github as a platform and as a login system</li>
</ul>
<p><span>There is an open source variation of GitHub called GitLab. Gitlab is used by the university to share code internally (like WebAccess, security related code), automate workflows and increase collaboration between organizations.</span></p>
<p><span>For the purposes of this class we're going to focus on Github as it will provide the most visibility for you and what you are showcasing as being able to do.</span></p>
