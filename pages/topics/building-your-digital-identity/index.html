<p>No one knows who you are if you're not effectively communicating. I recall a colleague several years ago getting pissed that I was invited to speak some place. "It's like no one knows I exist or appreciates what I know". He was absolutely just as or more talented than I was... what was the difference?</p>
<ul><li>I've blogged openly about tech and life since 2008</li>
<li>I've got hundreds of YouTube videos ranging from "Hey look at this thing" to "let's learn about..." to "We're going to burn down this space"</li>
<li>I've got unified social media accounts that signal boost content from the other spaces</li>
</ul>
<p><span>As a result of having a unified social media front and regular presence on blogs / YouTube, I've gotten to speak nationally on a regular basis the last ten years. <b>Every recorded association of a brand or event to you personally is another form of signal boosting.</b>

<h3 id="header-be780c0c-cad3-1d68-4b17-3f6e709251d6"><span>Theory</span></h3>
<p><span>A theory I learned about in Grad school that stuck with me the most is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory">Actor Network Theory</a>
 (ANT). ANT can be argued as to if it's actually a theory, but the <b>TLDR;</b>
 is that all things influence each other.</span></p>

<p><span>For information sciences though, it's saying that anything created influences anything else created. This is particularly potent in the digital space when we can create a logo, brand, business, website, identity, or platform seemingly out of thin air. If I post on YouTube, I'm not just broadcasting there and increasing my brand recognition in that space. It's aggregated to blogs, it shows up in Google and Bing search results. Its lifted for replication on Russian botnet sites.</span></p>
<p><span>All of this, amplifies your voice and reach far beyond you speaking in public (again, duh). But if you recognize this, you can also weaponize it to your advantage (or be a Russian troll bot online and corrupt other countries cultures, I mean tomatoe tomatto). WithÂ <span>intentionality</span>, we can increase our profile as technology professionals and begin to build a portfolio that anyone can stumble on (or seek out intentionally) to increase their knowledge.</span></p>
