<p>Drupal is the worlds most powerful, most complex and as a result, the most expensive CMS. We'll explore Drupal's concepts and do some data modeling together in class. Then we'll use Drupal to model those relationships in the website.</p>
<p>We'll learn about Content Types and fields to model data. Then we'll use Views in order to visualize that data and work with content entry to make sense of it all.</p>
<p>Drupal is daunting at first but once you learn the concepts and experience them they form a repeatable pattern of development and site building that leads you into a large community with lots of financial opportunities.</p>
