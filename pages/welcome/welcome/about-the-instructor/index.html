<p>My name is Bryan Ollendyke and I've been <strike>living</strike>
 working at Penn State since 2007. I did my undergrad in IST and was able to get a job working in the College of Arts & Architecture's online learning unit called The Office of Digital Learning.</p>

<p>In 2015 I completed my <b>Master of Science</b>
 (MS) by studying the spread of an open source platform called Drupal. I came up with a phrase to identify what I found through interviews that I've come to call Information Altruism - Meaning that it isn't open source software that impacts institutions <b>but the free giving away of the knowledge of how to use them </b>
that does.</p>
<p>Open source lays the ground work, but it still requires knowledge workers to pick up those raw minerals and make rails of them for organizations to ride on.</p>

I've contributed <b>hundreds</b>
 of modules to Drupal CMS, dozens of themes and installation profiles, millions of lines of code liberated from the ownership of anyone or anywhere.</p>

<p>In the last two years, our team has released north of 400 reusable design assets called Web components. These modules and design assets power thousands of websites and help empower people we'll never know to better express themselves online, whether for instructional content or otherwise.</p>
<p>I am a self described <b><i><a href="https://youtu.be/f_tEA9O9pco?t=183">Developer Activist</a>
</i>
 </b>
in that I don't think open source can change society: I know it can and does constantly. It's why I still work in academia - to try and open source as much of the application stack associated with teaching and learning in order to provide both better options as well as lower costs.</p>
