<h2 id="header-dcacbf4b-cf90-c56d-5e00-85fcca9fe2aa">Spring 2020 project</h2>
<p>The last weeks of the semester there will be a slightly longer lab that I'm calling a project. You'll have to put together a pitch for one of multiple problem spaces but it's a technical pitch. You'll be asked to use as many technologies we used in the course to express how your solution will utilize these technologies, while it still being in the form of a pitch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/BryanOllendyke1/lecture-14-oer-final-project" target="_blank" title="Open Activism project">Slides for the Open Activism Project.</a>
</p>
<p>There are two ways to accomplish the final project based on how you want to solve it. If you want to learn more about front end development tooling, web components, and contributing to an open source project, skip to prompt 2. Otherwise, do prompt 1.</p>
<h2 id="header-ea514d18-02a8-00fe-26a1-4d7764e58d9d">Prompt 1: Final project problem identification</h2>
<p>Identify a topic in your current or past courses that was poorly covered or you felt was something that you could have Google’d and done a better job. Many of you have expressed this sentiment to me throughout the semester, now it's time to prove it.<br/></p>
<ul><li>Do this now in class</li>
<ul><li>If you can think of one, cool</li>
<li>If not, take time now and find one</li>
</ul>
<li><span>Pitch me (in Slack) the topic</span></li>
<li><span><b>I have to approve the topic (it just has to be </b>
<b>relevant</b>
<b> and something that can be covered in depth over 10-20 pages of content / media)</b>
</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-62d51d42-c2e3-0d74-a140-4c4ba453b0e1">Prompt 1: Deliverable</h2>
<p>Create a Draw.io diagram or supporting materials that create a technical solution to this problem:</p>
<ul><li>Open Educational Materials are difficult to make (Editor Experience)</li>
<li>They are difficult to find (SEO)</li>
<li>Must be accessible / performant (A11y + Performance minded)</li>
<li>They are hard to maintain (Open source / CMS communities)</li>
<li>They require a lot of training / examples for faculty to "get it"</li>
</ul>
<p>Translating those requirements to technical ones. OER can leverage the CMS, Web, hosting, deployment, accessibility and other topics we covered this semester to create a solution. I want you to use the topics of this course to generate a prototype for presenting online course materials, and then create working prototype that uses a topic you felt wasn't covered in your college career in order to demonstrate the platform you create for OER purposes.</p>
<p>Examples of a valid solution</p>
<ul><li><b>Valid example 1</b>
: You love how easy it is to build a <b>HAXcms</b>
 <b>site</b>
 and think building things rapidly is more important than multiple-author workflows. Your diagram shows the 4 steps to find and embed a YouTube video or Wikipedia article, which are great ways to construct references to other work. You pick <b>5 G technology</b>
 because you see a lot of misinformation on the internet about it but not a lot of facts covered in class. You make a 20 page site with lots of media, self checks, videos, Wikipedia articles and more to explain to people that no, 5G is not a super weapon developed by space aliens to control society. Then you create a video explaining why your <b>HAXcms base solution</b>
 should be used by the university to develop OER materials because of <b>ease of use</b>
.</li>
<li><b>Valid example 2</b>
: Diagram about how multiple content contributors can build courses faster than individuals. For this purpose, you recommend <b>Drupal</b>
 because of multi-author support as well as it being an open source solution developers can maintain. You then pick <b>BlueTooth</b>
 because it wasn't covered in any of your classes and you feel it's really important for <b>network engineers</b>
 to learn about. You create a <i>15 page site</i>
 with lots of <i>media and links</i>
 all about bluetooth. Then you create a video explaining why your <b>Drupal based solution </b>
is the way to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bolded words in here are largely variable. So if you think GravCMS, WordPress, HAXcms or Static HTML would make better alternatives then you are more than welcome to do those! The idea is to <b>make and justify your technology selection</b>
<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>For context, <i>Penn State currently has Drupal, WordPress, Proprietary and HAXcms based OER platforms</i>
. So there's <i><b>more than one right answer here</b>
</i>
 as past employees have clearly made the case for other platforms (</span><font face="var(--haxcms-base-styles-body-font-family, Noto Serif, serif)"><span>my bias alert</span></font>
<span>: even if WordPress and Drupal are highly difficult to use so no one's really building courses in them. *cough*)</span></p>
<p>Create a persuasive video that make the case for OER AND why your platform / technology chosen is an easy solution for faculty to adopt.</p>
<h2 id="header-7db73e39-51f9-0a94-8207-df14f01dcf30">Video pitch</h2>
<p>Create a video that can be used to convince an instructor of the benefits of your OER platform solution. Why OER is important is nice, but more importantly is why <i><b>YOUR OER solution</b>
</i>
 is ease to use or what ever you technical slant is on the solution. Can they maintain it without being really technical? Can they share material easily with other faculty? Think of what your professors would have as concerns in adopting your solution and make the "sales pitch" for your solution based on alleviating those fears and highlighting the strengths of your approach.</p>
<h2 id="header-be2493d5-0e99-6f26-19b0-ecf9a183f31a">Prompt / scenario 2: Developer activist in training</h2>
<p>If you didn't notice, the scope of HAXcms and our efforts surrounding it are pretty ambitious. We have a massive issue queue with problems big and small. Many of you identified multiple issues in your video review of HAXcms. In exchange for contributing your solutions to problems openly, I am willing to wave the final project in exchange for project contributions.</p>
<p>This is a micro-independent study for those wanting to do more development and learn about contribution to a real project. If your not a senior I'd also recommend this option as I offer independent study programming opportunities and this is a step into whether you'd want to do that in the future.</p>
<p>What this looks like:</p>
<ul><li>DM me on Slack about your interest in developing front end web components that could be reused in the future. I'll help you get tooling setup and pointed to additional resources to get building a "hello-world" quickly so that you're in position to contribute.</li>
<li>We will agree upon a reasonable scope of work (this is personalized) most likely being the development of a single web component and getting it added into our mono-repo. Posting issues you identify along the way.</li>
<ul><li>This could also be an issue you ran into in your walk through of HAXcms that you'd like to try and tackle. I'll help determine how possible this is from a scope standpoint.</li>
<li>We have lots of smaller web components that are completely in scope of doing in a 2 week period</li>
</ul>
<li>You write a blog post on dev.to at the end explaining how your web component works or how someone can start contributing to HAXcms or any of our various efforts surrounding the platform. Example of the way a blog post would look / scope:</li>
<ul><li><a href="https://dev.to/collinkleest/how-to-build-a-basic-web-component-with-lit-element-30hl">How to build a basic Web Component with LitElement</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://dev.to/btopro/simplewc-json-driven-web-components-1jd8">My article about an experimental functional web component technique</a>
</li>
</ul>
<li><i>I can only handle so many of this option so this will be limited to 5 people</i>
.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-7923d8be-0566-77b0-200b-d535cdbb93c1">Rubric for scenario 1</h2>
<p>Did you create a comprehensive resource for  teaching a topic that’s missing? (50%)</p>
<ul><li>Bring in at least 10 media / special elements to liven up your resource and make it more engaging</li>
<li>Reference resources (videos, playlists, links, Wikipedia articles, blog posts, etc)</li>
<li>Is built in a CMS we covered this semester</li>
</ul>
<p>Is the video persuasive to faculty? (50%)</p>
<ul><li>Did you explain why OER is often easier for you to learn or at minimum a cheaper option for you as a learner.</li>
<li>Did you "sell" faculty on ease of use or other features of your solution</li>
<li>Did you describe the way this technology makes their life easier</li>
<li>Did you describe how they could share this material with others</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-ae48847d-bd83-c973-1e7d-1e62142412cb"><span>Rubric for Scenario 2</span></h2>
<p><span>This will be worked out on a case by case basis but will be 50% for the web component working / meeting requirements and 50% for your blog post explaining how to contribute to the project, how your element works, and what this experience was like.</span></p>
