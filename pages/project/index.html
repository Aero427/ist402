<h2 id="header-dcacbf4b-cf90-c56d-5e00-85fcca9fe2aa">Spring 2020 project</h2>
<p>The last weeks of the semester there will be a slightly longer lab that I'm calling a project. You'll have to put together a pitch for one of multiple problem spaces but it's a technical pitch. You'll be asked to use as many technologies we used in the course to express how your solution will utilize these technologies, while it still being in the form of a pitch.</p>

</p>
<p>There are two ways to accomplish the final project based on how you want to solve it. If you want to learn more about front end development tooling, web components, and contributing to an open source project, skip to prompt 2. Otherwise, do prompt 1.</p>
<h2 id="header-ea514d18-02a8-00fe-26a1-4d7764e58d9d">Prompt 1: Final project problem identification</h2>
<p>Identify a topic in your current or past courses that was poorly covered or you felt was something that you could have Google’d and done a better job. Many of you have expressed this sentiment to me throughout the semester, now it's time to prove it.<br/></p>
<ul><li>Do this now in class</li>
<ul><li>If you can think of one, cool</li>
<li>If not, take time now and find one</li>
</ul>
<li><span>Pitch me (in Slack) the topic</span></li>
<li><span><b>I have to approve the topic (it just has to be </b>
<b>relevant</b>
<b> and something that can be covered in depth over 10-20 pages of content / media)</b>
</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-62d51d42-c2e3-0d74-a140-4c4ba453b0e1">Prompt 1: Deliverable</h2>
<p>Create a Draw.io diagram or supporting materials that create a solution to this problem:</p>
<ul><li>Open Educational Materials are difficult to make (Editor Experience)</li>
<li>They are difficult to find (SEO)</li>
<li>Must be accessible / performant (A11y + Performance minded)</li>
<li>They are hard to maintain (Open source / CMS communities)</li>
<li>They require a lot of training / examples for faculty to "get it"</li>
</ul>
<p>Translating those requirements to technical ones. OER needs platforms that can be maintained without overly technical users (CMS site builders / content contributors), that are configured to </p>
<p>Create a comprehensive resource in <a href="https://iam.hax.psu.edu">https://iam.hax.psu.edu</a>
 that covers your approved topic in detail and <b>with a variety of engaging elements. </b>
This should be a topic poorly covered in a class you are / have taken OR A topic that you feel has been lacking in proper coverage in your major!<br/></p>
<p>Create two persuasive videos that make the case for OER and specifically your resource to two different audiences</p>
<h2 id="header-7db73e39-51f9-0a94-8207-df14f01dcf30">Video 1</h2>
<p>Create a video that “sells” an instructor on why they should use the resource you created over one from a publisher</p>
<p> Demonstrate how easy it is to create / modify</p>
<p>Identify open resources you used to help create your resource</p>
<p>Identify resources (services offered, websites, technologies, etc) <b>at Penn State</b>
 that faculty can leverage to produce more OER<br/></p>
<h2 id="header-617febfc-f59d-e7f0-5243-65612b5718ce">Video 2</h2>
<p>There is a curricular rewrite in your college and <b>Associate Dean Fusco</b>
 is reviewing topics. Pitch AD Fusco on why this topic should be a core piece of the curriculum and is important for people in your major to learn from YOUR perspective!</p>
<p>AD Fusco <i>is very technical too</i>
. So, sell him on how <b>hax.psu.edu</b>
 could be <b><i>used by other faculty</i>
</b>
 (either through demonstration or draw.io diagrams to explain possibilities).</p>
<p>Here are some possible reasons: sustainability, accessibility, remixability, SEO, good press, portability of content, maintenance, etc.</p>
<h2 id="header-7923d8be-0566-77b0-200b-d535cdbb93c1">Rubric</h2>
<p>Did you create a comprehensive resource for  teaching a topic that’s missing? (50%)</p>
<ul><li>Bring in at least 10 media / special elements to liven up your resource and make it more engaging</li>
<li>Reference resources (videos, playlists, links, Wikipedia articles, blog posts, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Is video one persuasive to faculty? (25%)</p>
<p>Is video two persuasive to administration? (25%)</p>
<h2 id="header-ac468ec7-e248-c810-0e22-dc88cbd4f382">Submitting</h2>
<p>Embed links to videos on 1st page of your site</p>
<p>Post link to the <b>#final-project</b>
 slack channel<br/></p>
<p>You have until <b>May 4th</b>
 to turn this in</p>
